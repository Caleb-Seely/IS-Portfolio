A modular rainwater collection system designed for off-grid cabins and eco-retreats. Built for easy transport and intuitive setup, it filters and stores up to 50 gallons of clean water.

### Features

* Stackable containers with food-safe lining
* Integrated first-flush diverter for cleaner collection
* Quick-connect hose system for flexible routing

### Outcomes & Challenges

* **Improved water purity** with an inline charcoal and UV system
* **Modular design** allowed for scaling up or down per site
* **Cold weather testing** revealed a need for insulated valves

### Reflection

Designing for self-reliance taught me how much every part of a system contributes to trust in the whole. I wanted something you could install and forgetâ€”because it's just that reliable.
