The **Solar-Powered Lantern** is a compact, durable, and energy-efficient lighting solution designed for outdoor enthusiasts who value sustainability. Created with minimalist backpackers in mind, this lantern is lightweight yet resilient, using recycled aluminum for the casing and a high-efficiency solar panel for renewable power.


Inspired by the need for reliable, off-grid lighting during extended hikes, this project focused on balancing form and function while adhering to eco-conscious design principles. The lantern provides soft, ambient light with long-lasting LED bulbs and charges fully in just a few hours of direct sunlight.


### Features
- USB-C port for backup charging
- Glow-in-the-dark power button for ease of use at night
- Collapsible handle for packability
- 3 brightness modes for various scenarios


### Outcomes & Challenges
- **Reduced plastic usage**: All components were chosen to minimize synthetic materials; final product contains 85% recycled or biodegradable parts.
- **Learned about solar efficiency**: Initial models underperformed in low light; iterated panel placement and tilt to improve charge speed.
- **User feedback**: Field-tested by local hikers and campers, who appreciated the warm lighting and compact design.
- **Supply sourcing**: Sourcing ethical aluminum was harder than expectedâ€”took extra time to find verified suppliers.


### Reflection
This project pushed my understanding of both renewable energy integration and sustainable materials sourcing. It reminded me that even small products can have a big environmental impact when designed thoughtfully. I'm proud of how it turned out and excited to keep refining it with future iterations.
