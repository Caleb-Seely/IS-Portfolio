These sustainable trekking poles combine strength and shock absorption using heat-treated bamboo and natural cork grips. They're surprisingly light and reduce impact without sacrificing feel.

### Features
- Ergonomic cork grip wicks moisture
- Shock-absorbing bamboo flex
- Adjustable length with recycled aluminum locks

### Outcomes & Challenges
- **Studied bamboo cross-sectioning** for best strength-to-weight ratio
- **Handle ergonomics** refined using hand molds
- **Weatherproofing** achieved with plant-based sealant

### Reflection
Bambooâ€™s natural flex changed how I thought about energy return in movement. A joy to build, and even more fun to take hiking.
