A lightweight, pack-flat stove for ultralight backpackers, this design focuses on compactness and clean-burning biofuel. The stove unfolds in seconds and can boil water in under 4 minutes.

### Features
- Biofuel-compatible with clean combustion
- Heat-resistant folding ceramic panels
- Stable tripod base for uneven terrain

### Outcomes & Challenges
- **Tested stability** on rocky surfaces with varying pot sizes
- **Burn efficiency** tuned through multiple airflow chamber designs
- **Sourcing ceramic panels** took longer than expected but paid off in durability

### Reflection
This project showed me how much efficiency matters in minimalist design. Every gram and degree of heat retention counted. A simple tool, but one thatâ€™s endlessly rewarding to optimize.
