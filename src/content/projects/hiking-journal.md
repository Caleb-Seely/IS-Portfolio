This waterproof field journal is built for hikers who like to document their routes, sketches, and reflections along the trail — even in bad weather. It’s tear-resistant and crinkle-free, made entirely from sustainable sources.

### Features
- Compact pocket size with lay-flat binding
- Stone paper won’t tear, soak, or warp
- Printed with eco-safe, biodegradable inks

### Outcomes & Challenges
- **Paper testing** revealed how well stone paper works even in snow
- **Binding durability** tested by backpackers and bikers over 2 months
- **Recycled leather cover** adds a natural tactile feel

### Reflection
This project was about slowing down. Creating something for people to unplug with gave me the space to explore tactile design in a way that digital-first work rarely allows.
