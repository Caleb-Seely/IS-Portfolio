A shelter system designed to adapt: tarp, tent, and bivy modes all from one pack. Built from upcycled marine materials, this shelter resists wind and water while remaining ultralight.

### Features
- Three configurations: tarp, tent, hammock fly
- Reflective anchors and compression sack
- Fits in a 2L side-pocket when packed

### Outcomes & Challenges
- **Balancing tension** across multiple configurations was difficult
- **Upcycled material variance** led to minor weight inconsistencies
- **Tested durability** in high-altitude windstorms with great success

### Reflection
Designing this was like building a Swiss army knife from trash. It reinforced how much potential there is in reuse â€” and how design can extend product life without compromise.
